# Room Reservation System for Hacettepe University

For our Database Management Systems' final project, me and my teammate designed a reservation system using Flask for backend and Jinja templates and Javascript for frontend. 

This project focuses on database design and transdaction management. UI & UX is not focused on because it was used mainly for testing functionality. 

## Users & Functionalities:
- There are 3 types of users: admins (department secretaries), instructors and students. Each have different permissions.
- User can make a reservation for one time or a recurring reservation.
- User can delete reservation.
- User can change reservation date and time.
- If the desired timeslot is reserved, the system suggests other rooms that meet the wanted criteria.
- User can request a feature (internet, boardmarker etc.) for a room or if the feature is not working, user can notify the admins through the system. 

## DevOps
Although not wanted by the original project, I tried to create a CI/CD process using Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins.
